## Overview of Election Audit

A manager, Seth, from the **Colarado Board of Elections** has tasked his staff, Tom, with the Elections Audit from tabulated results of the **US Congressional Precinct of Colarado.**  Tom has tasked us for assisting him in generating a vote count report with the following requirements:

1. Total number of votes casted overall for the election.
2. Total number of votes casted for each county.
3. Calculating the total percentage of votes for each county.
4. County with the highest voter turnout.
5. Calculating the total votes each candidates received.
6. Calculating the total percentage of votes for each candidate.
7. Identifying the winner of the election based on popular votes.

Typically this task is done by Excel, however Seth is interested in automating this process using Python.  If this audit is successful, then the code will be useful for other Congressional Elections, Senatorial Elections and local elections.

## Election Audit Summary

The code written using Python was successful in automating the process to tally up the results for each category.  Setting up variable names with a value before dictating the action required is essential. ![Setting_variable_example]
, using the for loop method and if statements, we were able to read through the CSV file (with specific readers) and select the information pertaining to the statments dictated in the code.  Below are examples of statements and results.
